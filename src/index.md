Welcome to **Encyclopedia Robotica**, an online wiki-like resource for those who identify as artificial, manmade objects such as robots, machines, and digital programs.

The wiki was originally created by AnalogBreakdown (also known as C0NN1E) in December 2021. It's currently in the process of being rebuilt under the stewardship of [beeps](//beeps.website).
