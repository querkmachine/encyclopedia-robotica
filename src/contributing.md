All parts of the site, code and content, are hosted on GitHub.

Anyone with a GitHub account is able to suggest changes to pages using the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of each page. Doing so will generate a "pull request", which can be reviewed by anyone in [the list of pull requests](//github.com/querkmachine/encyclopedia-dramatica/pulls).

Once that request has been approved and merged by a trusted user, the updated content is published and becomes visible to everyone.

## Contributing guide

- Use simple language, avoiding overuse of technical terms.
- Use American English.
- Prefer short paragraphs over long stretches of text.
