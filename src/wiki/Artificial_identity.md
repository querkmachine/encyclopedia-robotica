**Artificial identity** (also called **synthetic identity**) is a personal identity that aligns itself with artificial, human-made materials or objects. It can be considered a subset of being [objectkin] and is part of the larger [nonhuman] umbrella.

Artifically identifying individuals may identify as mechanical devices such as [robots], [machines], or vehicles; digital concepts such as [artificial intelligence] or [programs]; traditionally inanimate creations such as plush toys, clothing or furniture; or beings made of manufactured materials like latex or plastics.
