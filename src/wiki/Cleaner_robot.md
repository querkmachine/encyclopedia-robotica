**Cleaner robots** are a type of robot created with the purpose of cleaning various surfaces. These often, but not always, resemble some sort of cleaning appliance. Cleaner robots of this type will most likely resemble a vacuum cleaner, dubbed a Robovac.

## History

Cleaner robots, also known as robovacs, are an older idea than believed. One of the earliest examples of such a robot is featured in the 1956 science fiction novel _The Door Into Summer_. In this book, it is described as being "a better vacuum cleaner."[^1]

Such robots have become real with time, with the iRobot Roomba (introduced in 2002) being the most well known. Around the same time, Electrolux introduced a robovac named Trilobite.[^2] It should be noted that cleaner robots in fiction are much more heavily anthropomorphized than most real robovacs.

## In popular culture

Cleaning robots are popular in science fiction and childrens media, such as MO from _WALL-E_, QT from _Space Dandy_, and Noo-Noo from _Teletubbies_, who are each sentient vacuum cleaners.

Rosie from _The Jetsons_, one of the earliest examples of a cleaning robot in television media, is a housemaid capable of cooking and other tasks in addition to cleaning.

"Zima Blue", an episode of _Love, Death & Robots_' second season, features an interview with the titular Zima Blue, a reclusive artist who is assumed by humanity to be a [cyborg]. He reveals through the interview that he is actually an advanced [android], augmented over generations by a number of previous owners. He reveals his final artwork after the interview: a swimming pool, in which he casts off his modifications and returns to his original existence as a swimming pool cleaning robot.

In live-action media, Kryton from the British sci-fi comedy series _Red Dwarf_ is initially found as a cleaning android. He diversifies his programming as the series progresses, although maintains a love of cleanliness.
