**Cyborgs** are the result of combining mechanical and organic components into a single entity, which is typically dependent upon both groups of components to operate and survive.

## In popular culture

### In real life

The definition of a cyborg has become blurred with time thanks to advances in medical science, where it is increasingly common for people to have prosthetic limbs, artifical organs and transplants either out of choice or necessity.

Whilst these people may be called cyborgs under the strict definition of the term, it is more typical for a cyborg to be someone who has had significant portions of their body replaced with electro-mechanical components.

People who wish to become cyborgs may be considered [transhumanists].

### In media

Prominent cyborgs in live-action media include Steve Austin in _The Six Million Dollar Man_, the Cybermen from _Doctor Who_, the Borg from _Star Trek_, and the eponymous _RoboCop_.

Cyborgs in animated media include _Inspector Gadget_, Android 18 from _Dragon Ball_, and General Grevious from _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_.

Some [androids] may loosely fit the definition of a cyborg due to the integration of some organic components, such as the T-800 from the _Terminator_ franchise, though they aren't universally considered to be cyborgs as they don't require their organic elements to function.

## In the robotkin community

Robotkin individuals may consider their real-life selves to be cyborgs in some manner, or otherwise aspire to become cyborgs in the typical science fiction sense.
