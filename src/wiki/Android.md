**Androids**, rarely called **mechanoids**, are robots that physically resemble humans.

The word android is sometimes used to mean robots with masculine characteristics, with **gynoid** used to refer to those with feminine characteristics, however, this distinction is not common outside of science fiction media.

Whilst rarely used, the term **androgynoid** may refer to robots with both masculine and feminine characteristics.

## History

The earliest use of the word android appears to have originated in 1728 encyclopedia _[Cyclopædia]_ by [Ephraim Chambers] (then called "androides"), which was in reference to a human-looking automaton supposedly created by [St. Albertus Magnus][^1].

By the late 1700s, androids started to appear in exhibits for display purposes and by 1863, the word android would appear in US patents referring to human-looking automaton toys.[^2] The word gynoid originated from a 1979 editorial written by [Isaac Asimov][][^3].

With the introduction of [Karel Čapek]'s famous play, _[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]_, the word 'robot' was introduced, which was often used interchangeably with android. Though, robot was used more to refer to all mechanical beings, not just those resembling humans.[^4]

Authors of stories have often used the term android in more diverse ways, such as in the novel _[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]_, where the artificially-created humans called "Replicants" are used as slaves. These Replicants have no mechanical components, but are called androids nonetheless.

## In popular culture

### In real life

Development of human-like robots have been a long-standing goal of many robotics companies.

The Japanese company Honda began development of self-regulating bipedal robots in 1986, with their first 'humanoid' model, the [P1], being unveiled in 1993. They released the first version of [ASIMO], potentially the most well known real world android.

Other real-world androids include [Miim (HRP-4C)], developed by AIST, Boston Dynamics' [Atlas], and NASA's [Valkyrie (R5)].

### In media

Androids are one of the most widespread ways that robots are depicted in media, due to the ease of casting humans in the role.

Examples of androids in live-action media include Data in the _Star Trek_ franchise, C3-PO in the _Star Wars_ franchise, and Vision in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Using computer-generated imagery to depict androids with less human-like appearances is also common, such as Sonny in 2004's _I, Robot_ and the eponymous CHAPPiE in _CHAPPiE_.

Animated androids include Jenny Wakeman in _My Life as a Teenage Robot_, Robot in _Robot Dreams_, and Bender Rodriguez in _Futurama_.

Androids appearing in literature include Andrew Martin in Isaac Asimov's _The Bicentennial Man_, Marvin the Paranoid Android in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, and Murderbot/SecUnit in _The Murderbot Diaries_ series of novels.

Some androids, such as Murderbot and the T-800 of the _Terminator_ franchise, include organic components as enhancements to their bodies, however they do not require these components to work, so may still be considered true androids.

A common trope of androids in media involves them desiring to become more human, such as Data and Andrew. These characters may temporarily or pemanently become [cyborgs] in the pursuit of becoming more human-like.

## In the robotkin community

Many robotkin individuals perceive themselves as androids, as it is easier to reconcile a human body plan with that of an android.
