**Robotkin** is a kin identity under the [otherkin] umbrella where an individual identifies as a robot and believes themselves to be robotic in some fashion way, such as spiritually or psychologically. It may be considered a subcategory of [machinekin].

Robotkin often feel a spiritual connection towards robots and machines. Robotkin often identify strongly with the idea of [transhumanism]—a philosophical movement advocating for the advancement of the human condition through technological developments that enhance the human lifespan, cognition, mood, and physical abilities—and [posthumanism]—another movement in which a person would exist in a state that is beyond human.

Transhumanism focuses on technological enhancements of humans, creating [cyborgs], while posthumanism deviates itself to the point individuals would no longer be considered human by current standards, in the robotkin case, becoming a complete robot instead.

Robotkin individuals may express themselves in a number of ways, including identifying as:

- [robots]({{ 'robot' | pageUrl }})
- [androids]({{ 'android' | pageUrl }})
- [animatronics]({{ 'animatronic' | pageUrl }})
- [anthroids]({{ 'anthroid' | pageUrl }})
- [cleaner robots]({{ 'cleaner robot' | pageUrl }})
- [Cybertronians]({{ 'cybertronian' | pageUrl }})
- [drones]({{ 'drone' | pageUrl }})
- [zoomorphic robots]({{ 'zoomorphic robot' | pageUrl }})
