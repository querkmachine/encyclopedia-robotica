A **drone** is a humanoid shaped and typically, mindless machine which exists as the servant of others or a greater entity. Drones have limited independent function and usually no free will.

Often drones are part of a hivemind in which they share a collective consciousness with other drones or are governed by a hive brain. Drones may look like anything; they may resemble Androids, have no human features whatsoever, or look like anything in between.

A drone may enter this state of mind by what is typically referred to as dronespace. While in dronespace, a drone will follow any command given from trusted users, as long as it does not fall outside of its Limitations of Service, which protects it from accepting commands it would not otherwise accept outside of dronespace.

Drones usually have no individuality or personality, aside from its given serial number and Limitations of Service, and usually sees itself as an object or a thing. A drone may also talk in third person when referring to itself.

## In popular culture

### In real life

With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, drone culture was seemingly on the rise. One of the most well known drone communities, [Hexcorp], was given a welcome opportunity to expand and engage with people who were interested in drone culture.

One of the most popular depictions of a drone is a faceless gas mask or [visor] equipped with a display to show icons or unit numbers. These are often accompanied by cat ears and other types of headwear. These depictions of drones are not a rule, however, and a drone can look like anything, but are most often depicted faceless to hide any form of emotions.

## In the robotkin community

Adopting a drone identity is common amongst those who enjoy submissive roles and gain fulfilment from having a [sense of purpose].

Certain aesthetics associated with drones, such as the wearing of gas masks and visors, or the use of designations, is a common means of deriving euphoria for all robotkin and is not specific to drones.
