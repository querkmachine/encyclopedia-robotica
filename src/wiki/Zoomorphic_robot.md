## History

## In popular culture

### In real life

Robots that resemble domestic pets have been popular children's toys, the most popular of which is probably Sony's [AIBO robot dog], first introduced in 1999.

The Spot, BigDog and LittleDog lines of robots developed by Bostom Dynamics use a quadrupedal design reminiscent of a canine to traverse terrain that's too rough for wheeled vehicles.

Mimicing the movement of real-world animals has been helpful in the development of wider robotics. [Robots that fly like bats] and [move like snakes] have been developed that are capable of navigating spaces too small for people or traditional drones.

Robots resembling animals have been created by documentarians to closely [observe animals in the wild] without disrupting their natural behaviours.

### In media

Examples of zoomorphic robots in media include 808 (a robot cat) in the video game _Hi-Fi Rush_ and Sox (also a cat) in the film _Lightyear_.

Killer robot dogs inspired by those manufactured by Boston Dynamics are the primary antagonists of the _Black Mirror_ episode "Metalhead".
