**Robotgender** is a gender identity where one feels their gender is heavily connected to robots and machines.

Robotgender people often feel a heavy connection towards computers, robots and machines and thus, may enjoy presenting as such, either physically or cosmetically.

Though the gender has some slight overlap with [robotkin], there are differences that set them apart. Robotgender people do not exclusively have to identify as a machine and inversely, robotkin do not exclusively have to identify as robotgender. That said, some robotkin may simply say their gender is robot and some robotgender people may say they are robots, but may not identify as one spiritually.
