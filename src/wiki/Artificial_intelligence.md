**Artificial intelligence** (abbreviated **AI**) is a program designed to make informed decisions based on prior experiences.

There are multiple kinds of artificial intelligence. AIs capable of human-level cognition are referred to as **artificial general intelligence** (AGI), whereas those that surpass human capabilities are called **artificial super intelligence** (ASI).

Contemporary, real-world AIs are classed as **artificial narrow intelligence** (ANI), as they're only capable of operating within a limited set of parameters. This includes machine learning and recognition systems, neural networks, and generative AI.

## In popular culture

### In real life

The development of AGI is a commonly stated goal of AI companies such as OpenAI.

ANIs are already in widespread use. This includes as digital assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa platforms; generative models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion; and machine learning systems like IBM Watson and Wolfram Mathematica.

The present day use of ANIs and the potential development of AGIs are often controversial due to their potential for misuse by bad actors and risks associated with allowing them to operate without sufficient oversight.

### In media

Disembodied artificial general intelligences are a staple of science fiction media.

They are frequently depicted as antagonists that are malevolent towards humans, such as HAL-9000 in _2001: A Space Odyssey_, AM in _I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_, or Agent Smith in _The Matrix_ franchise.

Others may be helpful, such as Zora in _Star Trek: Discovery_, EOS in _Thunderbirds Are Go_, and JARVIS in _Iron Man_ films and comics.

Others still may be entirely neutral, making decisions without regard for humans, such as the Magi from _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ and V'Ger in _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_.

Where the setting allows, a frequent trope is for artificial intelligences to interact via the use of holograms, such as the Doctor in _Star Trek: Voyager_ and Cortana in the _Halo_ video games.

## In the robotkin community

AI-identifying robotkin may describe being without a physical form, like being inside a computer or being a hologram.

Though most robotkin tend to technically fall under the definitions of an AI housed within a mechanical body, the term is most often used with this definition in mind.
