The Encyclopedia Robotica (ER) wiki was originally created by AnalogBreakdown (also known as C0NN1E) in December 2021 with the aim of documenting and providing resources and information for those who identify as or with robots or machines.

AnalogBreakdown ceased involvement with the wiki in 2024, leading to the original wiki being closed down by the hosting company. It's currently in the process of being rebuilt under the stewardship of beeps (B47-R0).

## What ER is

**This website is about the robotkin community.** It does not aim to debate the existence of machine identities, nor should it cover topics that are not related to the community.

**This website is a guide** for those who want to know more, or are only just learning, about machine identities. It should use accessible language and be upfront about what is involved.

## What ER is not

**This website is not a wiki, but it is _wiki-like_.** Suggesting edits, big or small, is welcomed, but they must be approved prior to merging. This helps maintain a standard of editorial quality and prevent vandalism.

**This website is not Wikipedia.** Much of what is here is based on lived experiences and collectively defined norms. There is no requirement to be neutral or to formally cite references for what is written.

## Robotkin vs. machinekin vs. everything else

There isn't a generally accepted term to refer to the entire community, with those in common use including robotkin, machinekin, AI-kin, machine identifying, artificially identifying, and synthetic otherkin.

For the sake of simplicity, this website currently uses **robotkin** as a catch-all term for all of the above. The website's name says 'robot' after all!

## Stewards

These are the bots responsible for maintaining Encyclopedia Robotica.
